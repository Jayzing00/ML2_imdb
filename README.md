# ML2_imdb

Welcome to my ML2 project.
Everything you need to know about this project is either in code itself or written down in the Information.docx.
Be aware that the upload of the dataset takes some time!
Due to the fact that some of the models are too large, I uploaded them on Google Drive. You can download them here:

You can also run the code on google colab and see that the models get saved into the results folder.

Feel free to contact me via nageljay@students.zhaw.ch or on whatsapp if you have any questions regarding my model(s).

Best of luck for the exam, Jay!
